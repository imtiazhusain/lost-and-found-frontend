Next js env variable
Server-side: Any environment variable (including those without the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix) can be accessed in API routes or getServerSideProps/getStaticProps functions.
Client-side: Only variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are embedded into the client-side JavaScript bundle and thus accessible in the browser.


The event.target.files![0] ensures TypeScript knows that files is not null or undefined.
            setInputs((values) => ({ ...values, [name]: event.target.files![0] }));
